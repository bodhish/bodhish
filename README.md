# ðŸ‘‹Hey,

I am Bodhi, a digital nomad from Kerala, India.

I started to learn development while I was in school tinkering around with the school website which ended up being a part-time hobby in life.

I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electronics and Communication engineering and figured out that my passion was product building and development. [Building a student startup while in college changed my life](https://blog.sv.co/from-a-routine-college-life-to-life-of-a-student-entrepreneur-51a2fed29844). It gave me the confidence and drive to build and ship open products. With [multiple continuous failures](https://bodhish.in/), I learned to build, polish and deploy better ideas.

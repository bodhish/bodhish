### ✨ Building Tech for Social Impact

Hey! I'm a fullstack developer who loves building open-source solutions that make a difference. Leading the Digital Public Goods team at [Pupilfirst](https://github.com/pupilfirst) and running the [Open Healthcare Network](https://ohc.network) (a Digital Public Good!), I get to work on some really impactful projects.

Back in school, I started tinkering with websites – and that curiosity never stopped. Now, I mix AI with healthcare tech, build tools for better education, and work with amazing developers worldwide. Pretty cool that GitHub made me a Star in 2024! 🌟

- **Making Healthcare & Education Better:** Building open tech that helps save lives and students learn better
- **AI That Actually Helps:** Creating tools that make developers more productive and healthcare more accessible
- **Growing Communities:** Working with awesome developers globally and helping newcomers make their first open-source contributions
